# Transformer-from-Scratch-Neural-Machine-Translator
This project involves building and training from scratch of a full Transformer based Neural Machine Translation in PyTorch for English-Kannada translation. Implemented from the paper "Attention Is All You Need". Deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time inference using greedy decoding.
